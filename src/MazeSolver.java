    class by calling the abstract methods listed above.
    In order to keep track of which squares have previously been added to the worklist, you will "mark" each square that you place in the worklist. 
    Then, before you add a square to the worklist, you should first check that it is not marked (and if it is, refrain from adding it).
    Here is the suggestion for marking a Square: have each Square keep track of which Square added it to the worklist 
    (i.e., "Which Square was being explored when this Square was added to the worklist?"). 
    That is, add a new class member Square previous to the Square class, which will represent the Square previous to the current one; 
    initialize this variable to null in the constructor/reset method. Then, when a Square is being added to the list for the first time, 
    you will set the previous variable to point to the current Square (the Square that is being explored). 
    If the previous variable is already non-null, then this Square has already been placed on the list, and you should not do so again.
    You may also want to add in additional methods to your Square class to help you with this.*/
